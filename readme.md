# Computer Graphics Projects - University of Utah

This repository contains my solutions to the projects from the Computer Graphics course taught by Professor Cem Yuksel at the University of Utah. The course covers essential topics in computer graphics, and there are seven projects in total. Below is a checklist of the projects I am working on:

## Projects

- [ ] **Project 1: Compositing Images**
- [ ] **Project 2: Transformations**
- [ ] **Project 3: Curves**
- [ ] **Project 4: Triangular Meshes**
- [ ] **Project 5: Shading**
- [ ] **Project 6: Ray Tracing**
- [ ] **Project 7: Animation**

Each project will be stored in a separate folder with its source code and a detailed explanation of the implementation and results.

Stay tuned for updates as I complete each of the projects.
